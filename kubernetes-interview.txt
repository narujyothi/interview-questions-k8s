1. wt is the AKS? 
Ans: AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service) is a managed Kubernetes service by Microsoft Azure. 
It abstracts away the complexity of setting up and maintaining a Kubernetes control plane, 
allowing you to deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications easily.

2. wt is the diff b/w selfhosted and  AKS?

3. how AKS handle High availabilty?
ans: Yes, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) inherently handles high availability by deploying Kubernetes clusters 
     across multiple nodes within a Virtual Machine Scale Set, and can be further enhanced by deploying across availability zones, 
     ensuring application resilience and minimal downtime. 
4. what exactly side car containers in AKS?
ans: Sidecar containers are designed to enhance or extend the functionality of the main application container 
     by providing supporting processes, utilities, or services. 
    Example Use Cases:
	Logging: A sidecar container can collect and ship logs from the main application container to a central logging service. 	
	Monitoring: A sidecar container can monitor the health and performance of the main application container and report metrics. 
	Security: A sidecar container can handle tasks like encrypting or decrypting data, or providing access control. 
	Data Synchronization: A sidecar container can synchronize data between the main application container and a remote source. 
5.  difference between Network Load Balancer (NLB) and Application Load Balancer (ALB)?
ans: NLB operates at layer 4 (transport layer), handling TCP and UDP connections, while ALB operates at layer 7 (application layer), 
     processing HTTP/HTTPS traffic and supporting content-based routing

          Write-Host "accesses $(varA) from A"
       name: writevar
2. what is difference b/w functional app and logic app in azure infra?

ans: Azure Function Apps are code-based, allowing developers to write and execute code (e.g., in C#, Python) in response to events. 
Logic Apps offer a visual workflow designer, enabling users to create and automate workflows by connecting various services and systems without writing code
3. what is the landingzone?
ans: A landing zone is a pre-configured Azure environment that includes networking, identity, governance, security, and policies to host your applications. 
      It's the foundation for deploying workloads in a consistent, secure, and scalable way.
4. wt is are the deployment startegies? 
ans: rollingupdate,canary,blue/green deployment

5. wt is the difference b/w canary and blue/green deployments?
6. where u stored sentive data in ansible, azure pipeline and jenkins tell me?
7. how to store ur secretes in azure valut in ansible, azure & jenkins?
ans: - debug:
    msg: "{{ lookup('azure_keyvault_secret', 'secret-name', vault_url='https://<vault-name>.vault.azure.net/') }}"

8. wt are the build/depoyment steps?
ans: Build Phase:

Code checkout (Git)

Dependency install

Static code analysis / Linting

Unit tests

Build artifact (JAR, Docker image, etc.)

Push artifact to repo (Azure Artifacts, Nexus, DockerHub, etc.)

Deploy Phase:

Retrieve artifacts

Provision infrastructure (Terraform/ARM/Bicep)

Deploy app (Helm/K8s manifests, ARM templates, etc.)

Post-deploy checks

Notify teams (Slack, email, etc.)

9. ur using kubernetes for infra or deployment?
ans: deployment
10. hw to get user configuration in poershell
ans: Use the Get-MailboxUserConfiguration cmdlet.


11. what is API and NAT, when we used?
ans: You might use an API when you want to integrate your application with another service, 
    for example, using a third-party payment gateway or accessing data from a different database. 
   You might use NAT when you have a private network behind a firewall and need to connect to the internet or another network with a different IP address space. 
12. when we use internet gateway and Nat gateway?
ans: Internet Gateway:
     Allows both inbound (from the internet) and outbound (to the internet) traffic for instances with public IP addresses.
     NAT Gateway:
     Enables outbound-only internet access for instances with private IP addresses, providing a layer of security by preventing direct internet-to-instance connections. 
13. What is a Taint in Terraform?
A taint forces Terraform to destroy and recreate a resource on the next apply.

terraform taint <resource_type.name>

14. What is a Null Resource in Terraform?
A null_resource is used to execute arbitrary actions/scripts using provisioners (like local-exec or remote-exec) when there's no specific resource to tie them to.
resource "null_resource" "example" {
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo Hello World"
  }
}


15. explain  the CI/CD pipeline implementation?
A. we use github as a soucrce code repo and target platform is k8's
   then we use jenkins or azure piprline  for continuous integration 
   stages: 
   checkout the code, build & unit testing then code ansalysis(sonarcube),image building(will create container image),image scan,image push(ECR)
  here we used declarative pipeline


16. diff b/w pod and container?
A. Pod:
 A Pod can contain one or more containers.
All containers inside a Pod:
Share the same network namespace (same IP).
Can communicate via localhost.
Can share volumes/storage.
Container: 
Runs the software, service, or process.
A container lives inside a Pod when running in Kubernetes.
Cannot exist independently in Kubernetes without a Pod.
Easy Analogy:
| Concept        | Analogy                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Pod**        | A house                        |
| **Containers** | People living inside the house |
| **Pod IP**     | House address                  |
| **Volumes**    | Shared storeroom               |

17. diff b/w pod & deployment?
A. Pod: If a Pod dies, it does NOT automatically restart unless a controller manages it.
   deployment: A controller that manages ReplicaSets, which manage Pods.
     Ensures the desired number of Pods are always running.
      Handles:
        Auto-healing (recreates Pods)
        Scaling (increase/decrease replicas)
        Rolling updates
        Rollbacks
JSW:

1 what is the service principle and identity manage/manage identity
2. when ever disaster recovery is occure how u will get the data?
3. what is the difference b/w pod,deployment,service?
A. Pod contains one or more containers (usually 1 container).
   Pods are ephemeral (temporary).
   Pod IP changes every time it restarts.
   You never manage pods manually in a real environment.
	ex: apiVersion: v1
        kind: Pod
        metadata: 
          name: myapp
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: myapp
            image: nginx
=====================================
Deployment:  A Deployment manages pods.
Ensures the desired number of pods are running.
Provides self-healing (restarts pods if they crash).

apiVersion: v1
kind: Dployment 
metadata:
  name: myapp
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selectors: 
    matchLabel: 
      app: web
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: web
    spec:
    containers: 
       name: nginx
       image: nginx
================================================
Service: a service exposes pods to the internet
Why Services are needed?
Because pod IP changes, but service gives a stable IP + DNS name.
Types of Services:

ClusterIP → Internal access only (default)
NodePort → Exposes app on every worker node (30000–32767)
LoadBalancer → Creates cloud Load Balancer (AWS/Azure/GCP)
ExternalName → Maps DNS name to external service
ex:
 apiVersion: v1
 kind: service
 metadata:
   name: myservice
spec:
  selector:
    app: web
  ports: 
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  type: LoadBalancer

    git branch name, secret credentials, hostnames and ports, and so on.

4.i donn't want  to login jenkins server  and build job at 3pm ?
A. using cron jobs we can fix the time 
   Open your Jenkins job → click “Configure”.

	Scroll to the section “Build Triggers”.

	Check ✅ “Build periodically”.

	In the Schedule box, enter this:
       pipeline {
    agent any

    triggers {
        cron('0 15 * * *')  // Runs daily at 3 PM
    }

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo "Building application at 3 PM..."
